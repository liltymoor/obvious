## Description <a name = "description"></a>

**Obvious** - project that realizes programming language [**Obvious**](#obvious) and it's way to the **Obvious-CU**.

## Structure <a name = "structure"></a>
TODO Describe a project structure
### Features

- **Programming Lagnuage [[alg](empty)]** >> Syntax is **Javascript** based.
- **Architecture [[acc](empty)]** >> Architecture is **accumulator** based.
- **Memory Architecture [[neum](empty)]** >> Memory architecture is von-Neumann based.
- **Control Unit [[hw](empty)]** >> Control unit is **hardwired**.
- **Model accuracy [[tick](empty)]** >> [Obvious-processor](#obvious) model is **tick-based**.
- **Machine code [[binary](empty)]** >> [Obvious-translator](#obvious) translates code to **binary** machine code.
- **IO [[trap](empty)]** >> [Input/Output](#inputoutput-structure) is token-based and done with interruption to main life-cycle.
- **IO ISA [[port](empty)]** >> Special intructions are done to use IO.
- **String support [[pstr]](empty)** >> Strings are presented like **Pascal-string**.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

*TBD*

## Input/Output structure <a name = "io"></a>

At the start of the model we have an input like 

```python
 [(1, 'h'), (2, 'e'), (3, 'l'), (4, 'l'), (5, 'o')] 
```

**Number** means the time-moment when input should be done and the **symbol** is the actual input we pass to main life-cycle.

TODO append the IO description.
